[MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for secure command-line interactions on Windows systems, enabling controlled access to PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash shells, and remote systems via SSH. It allows MCP clients (like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)) to perform operations on your system, similar to [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This MCP server provides direct access to your system's command line interface and remote systems via SSH. When enabled, it grants access to your files, environment variables, command execution capabilities, and remote server management.
>
> - Review and restrict allowed paths and SSH connections
> - Enable directory restrictions
> - Configure command blocks
> - Consider security implications
>
> See [Configuration](#configuration) for more details.

See the [API](#api) section for more details on the tools and resources the server provides to MCP clients.

**Note**: The server will only allow operations within configured directories, with allowed commands, and on configured SSH connections.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@simonb97/server-win-cli"]
    }
  }
}
```

For use with a specific config file, add the `--config` flag:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@simonb97/server-win-cli",
        "--config",
        "path/to/your/config.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After configuring, you can:
- Execute commands directly using the available tools
- View configured SSH connections and server configuration in the Resources section
- Manage SSH connections through the provided tools

## Configuration

The server uses a JSON configuration file to customize its behavior. You can specify settings for security controls, shell configurations, and SSH connections.

1. To create a default config file, either:

**a)** copy `config.json.example` to `config.json`, or

**b)** run:

```bash
npx @simonb97/server-win-cli --init-config ./config.json
```

2. Then set the `--config` flag to point to your config file as described in the [Usage with Claude Desktop](#usage-with-claude-desktop) section.

### Configuration Locations

The server looks for configuration in the following locations (in order):

1. Path specified by `--config` flag
2. ./config.json in current directory
3. ~/.win-cli-mcp/config.json in user's home directory

If no configuration file is found, the server will use a default (restricted) configuration:

### Default Configuration

**Note**: The default configuration is designed to be restrictive and secure. Find more details on each setting in the [Configuration Settings](#configuration-settings) section.

### Configuration Settings

The configuration file is divided into three main sections: `security`, `shells`, and `ssh`.

#### Security Settings

```json
{
  "security": {
    // Maximum allowed length for any command
    "maxCommandLength": 1000,

    // Commands to block - blocks both direct use and full paths
    // Example: "rm" blocks both "rm" and "C:\\Windows\\System32\\rm.exe"
    // Case-insensitive: "del" blocks "DEL.EXE", "del.cmd", etc.
    "blockedCommands": [
      "rm", // Delete files
      "del", // Delete files
      "rmdir", // Delete directories
      "format", // Format disks
      "shutdown", // Shutdown system
      "restart", // Restart system
      "reg", // Registry editor
      "regedit", // Registry editor
      "net", // Network commands
      "netsh", // Network commands
      "takeown", // Take ownership of files
      "icacls" // Change file permissions
    ],

    // Arguments that will be blocked when used with any command
    // Note: Checks each argument independently - "cd warm_dir" won't be blocked just because "rm" is in blockedCommands
    "blockedArguments": [
      "--exec", // Execution flags
      "-e", // Short execution flags
      "/c", // Command execution in some shells
      "-enc", // PowerShell encoded commands
      "-encodedcommand", // PowerShell encoded commands
      "-command", // Direct PowerShell command execution
      "--interactive", // Interactive mode which might bypass restrictions
      "-i", // Short form of interactive
      "--login", // Login shells might have different permissions
      "--system" // System level operations
    ],

    // List of directories where commands can be executed
    "allowedPaths": ["C:\\Users\\YourUsername", "C:\\Projects"],

    // If true, commands can only run in allowedPaths
    "restrictWorkingDirectory": true,

    // If true, saves command history
    "logCommands": true,

    // Maximum number of commands to keep in history
    "maxHistorySize": 1000,

    // Timeout for command execution in seconds (default: 30)
    "commandTimeout": 30,

    // Enable or disable protection against command injection (covers ;, &, |, \`)
    "enableInjectionProtection": true
  }
}
```

#### Shell Configuration

```json
{
  "shells": {
    "powershell": {
      // Enable/disable this shell
      "enabled": true,
      // Path to shell executable
      "command": "powershell.exe",
      // Default arguments for the shell
      "args": ["-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-Command"],
      // Optional: Specify which command operators to block
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]  // Block all command chaining
    },
    "cmd": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "cmd.exe",
      "args": ["/c"],
      "blockedOperators": ["&", "|", ";", "`"]  // Block all command chaining
    },
    "gitbash": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
      "args": ["-c"],

    }
  }
}
```

#### SSH Configuration

```json
{
  "ssh": {
    // Enable/disable SSH functionality

    // Maximum number of failed keepalive attempts before disconnecting
    "keepaliveCountMax": 3,

    // Timeout for establishing SSH connections (in milliseconds)
    "readyTimeout": 20000,

    // SSH connection profiles
    "connections": {
      // NOTE: these examples are not set in the default config!
      // Example: Local Raspberry Pi
      "raspberry-pi": {
        "host": "raspberrypi.local", // Hostname or IP address
        "port": 22, // SSH port
        "username": "pi", // SSH username
        "password": "raspberry", // Password authentication (if not using key)

## Security Considerations

### Built-in Security Features (Always Active)

The following security features are hard-coded into the server and cannot be disabled:

- **Case-insensitive command blocking**: All command blocking is case-insensitive (e.g., "DEL.EXE", "del.cmd", etc. are all blocked if "del" is in blockedCommands)
- **Smart path parsing**: The server parses full command paths to prevent bypass attempts (blocking "C:\\Windows\\System32\\rm.exe" if "rm" is blocked)
- **Command parsing intelligence**: False positives are avoided (e.g., "warm_dir" is not blocked just because "rm" is in blockedCommands)
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated before execution
- **Shell process management**: Processes are properly terminated after execution or timeout
- **Sensitive data masking**: Passwords are automatically masked in resources (replaced with ********)

### Configurable Security Features (Active by Default)

These security features are configurable through the config.json file:

- **Command blocking**: Commands specified in `blockedCommands` array are blocked (default includes dangerous commands like rm, del, format)
- **Argument blocking**: Arguments specified in `blockedArguments` array are blocked (default includes potentially dangerous flags)
- **Command injection protection**: Prevents command chaining (enabled by default through `enableInjectionProtection: true`)
- **Working directory restriction**: Limits command execution to specified directories (enabled by default through `restrictWorkingDirectory: true`)
- **Command length limit**: Restricts maximum command length (default: 2000 characters)
- **Command timeout**: Terminates commands that run too long (default: 30 seconds)
- **Command logging**: Records command history (enabled by default through `logCommands: true`)

### Important Security Warnings

These are not features but important security considerations to be aware of:

- **Environment access**: Commands may have access to environment variables, which could contain sensitive information
- **File system access**: Commands can read/write files within allowed paths - carefully configure `allowedPaths` to prevent access to sensitive data
